=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.22.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.22.1 release and the 5.22.2
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.0, first read
L<perl5221delta>, which describes differences between 5.22.0 and 5.22.1.

=head1 Security

=head2 fix out of boundary access in Win32 path handling

This is CVE-2015-8608.  For more information see
L<[perl #126755]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126755>

=head2 fix loss of taint in canonpath

This is CVE-2015-8607.  For more information see
L<[perl #126862]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126862>

=head2 Set proper umask before calling C<mkstemp(3)>

In 5.22 perl started setting umask to 0600 before calling C<mkstemp(3)>
and restoring it afterwards. This wrongfully tells open(2) to strip
the owner read and write bits from the given mode before applying it,
rather than the intended negation of leaving only those bits in place.

Systems that use mode 0666 in C<mkstemp(3)> (like old versions of
glibc) createa a file with permissions 0066, leaving world read and
write permissions regardless of current umask.

This has been fixed by using umask 0177 instead. [perl #127322]

=head2 Avoid accessing uninitialized memory in win32 C<crypt()>

Added validation that will detect both a short salt and invalid characters
in the salt.  L<[perl #126922]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126922>

=head2 Remove duplicate environment variables from C<environ>

Previously, if an environment variable appeared more than once in
C<environ[]>, C<%ENV> would contain the last entry for that name,
while a typical C<getenv()> would return the first entry. We now
make sure C<%ENV> contains the same as what C<getenv> returns.

Second, we remove duplicates from C<environ[]>, so if a setting
with that name is set in C<%ENV> we won't pass an unsafe value
to a child process.

[CVE-2016-2381]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.22.1.
If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item *

L<XXX> has been upgraded from version A.xx to B.yy.

=head1 Documentation

=head2 Changes to Existing Documentation

=head3 L<perlfunc>

=over 4

=item *

The documentation of C<hex> has been revised to clarify valid inputs.

=back

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item *

Dtrace builds now build sucessfully on systems with a newer dtrace
that require an input object file that uses the probes in the F<.d>
file.

Previously the probe would fail and cause a build failure. [perl
#122287]

=item *

F<Configure> no longer probes for F<libnm> by default.  Originally
this was the "New Math" library, but the name has been re-used by the
GNOME NetworkManager.  [perl #127131]

=head1 Platform Support

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=over 4

=item ppc64el floating point

The floating point format of ppc64el (Debian naming for little-endian
PowerPC) is now detected correctly.

=item OS X/Darwin

Builds with both -DDEBUGGING and threading enabled would fail with a
"panic: free from wrong pool" error when built or tested from Terminal
on OS X.  This was caused by perl's internal management of the
environment conflicting with an atfork handler using the libc
setenv() function to update the environment.

Perl now uses setenv()/unsetenv() to update the environment on OS X.
[perl #126240]

=back

=head1 Internal Changes

=over 4

=item *

Remove unwarranted assertion in C<Perl_newATTRSUB_x()>. If a stub subroutine
definition with a prototype has been seen, then any subsequent stub (or
definition) of the same subroutine with an attribute was causing an assertion
failure because of a null pointer.
L<[perl #126845]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126845>

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

Calls to the placeholder C<&PL_sv_yes> used internally when an
import() or unimport() method isn't found now correctly handle scalar
context.  [perl #126042]

=item *

The pipe() operator would assert for DEBUGGING builds instead of
producing the correct error message.  The condition asserted on is
detected and reported on correctly without the assertions, so the
assertions were removed.  [perl #126480]

=item *

In some cases, failing to parse a here-doc would attempt to use freed
memory.  This was caused by a pointer not being restored correctly.
[perl #126443]

=item *

Report more context when we see an array where we expect to see an
operator and avoid an assertion failure.  [perl #123737]

=item *

If a here-doc was found while parsing another operator, the parser had
already read end of file, and the here-doc was not terminated, perl
could produce an assertion or a segmentation fault.  This now reliably
complains about the unterminated here-doc.  [perl #125540]

=item *

Caching of DESTROY methods could result in a non-pointer or a
non-STASH stored in the SvSTASH() slot of a stash, breaking the B
STASH() method.  The DESTROY method is now cached in the MRO metadata
for the stash.  [perl #126410]

=item *

Avoid parsing beyond the end of the buffer when processing a C<#line>
directive with no filename.  [perl #127334]

=item *

Perl 5.22 added support to the C99 hexadecimal floating point notation,
but sometimes misparses hex floats. This had been fixed.
[perl #127183]

=item *

Certain regex patterns involving a complemented posix class in an
inverted bracketed character class, and matching something else
optionally would improperly fail to match.  An example of one that could
fail is C</qr/_?[^\Wbar]\x{100}/>.  This has been fixed.
[perl #127537]

=item *

Fixed an issue with C<< pack >> where C<< pack "H" >> (and C<< pack "h" >>)
could read past the source when given a non-utf8 source, and a utf8 target.
[perl #126325]

=item *

Fixed some cases where perl would abort due to a segmentation fault,
or a C-level assert. [perl #126602], [perl #126193].

=item *

Avoid leaking memory when setting C<$ENV{foo}> on darwin.
L<[perl #126240]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126240>

=item *

Correctly raise an error when trying to compile patterns with
unterminated character classes while there are trailing backslashes.
[perl #126141].

=item *

Handle C<NOTHING> regops and C<EXACTFU_SS> regops in C<make_trie> properly.
[perl #126206]

=item *

Only test C<semctl> if we have everything needed to use it. In a FreeBSD
the C<semctl> entry point may exist, but it can be disabled by policy.
[perl #127533]

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
