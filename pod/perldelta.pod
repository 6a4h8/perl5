=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.30.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.30.0 release and the 5.30.1
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.29.0, first read
L<perl5300delta>, which describes differences between 5.29.0 and 5.30.0.

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.30.1.  If any exist,
they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See
L</Reporting Bugs> below.

=head1 Modules and Pragmata

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item *

L<Module::CoreList> has been upgraded from version 5.20190522 to 5.20191027.

=back

=head1 Configuration and Compilation

=over 4

=item *

The C<ECHO> macro is now defined.  This is used in a C<dtrace> rule
that was originally changed for FreeBSD, and the FreeBSD make
apparently predefines it.  The Solaris make does not predefine C<ECHO>
which broke this rule on Solaris.  [perl #134218]

=head1 Testing

Tests were added and changed to reflect the other additions and changes
in this release.

=head1 Platform Support

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

XXX List any changes for specific platforms.  This could include configuration
and compilation changes or changes in portability/compatibility.  However,
changes within modules for platforms should generally be listed in the
L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=item *

Setting C<$)> now properly sets supplementary group ids, if you have
the necessary privileges.  [perl #134169]

=item *

C<readline @foo> now evaluates C<@foo> in scalar context.  Previously
it would be evalauted in list context, and since readline() pops only
one argument from the stack, the stack could underflow, or be left
with unexpected values on the stack.  [perl #133989]

=item *

sv_gets() now recovers better if the target SV is modified by a signal
handler.  [perl #134035]

=item *

Matching a non-C<SVf_UTF8> string against a regular expression
containing unicode literals could leak a SV on each match attempt.
[perl #134390]

=item *

C<< sprintf("%.*a", -10000, $x) >> would cause a buffer overflow due
to mishandling of the negative precision value.  [perl #134008]

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/>.  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
