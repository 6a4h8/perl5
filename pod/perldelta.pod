=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.24.3

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.24.2 release and the 5.24.3
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.24.1, first read
L<perl5242delta>, which describes differences between 5.24.1 and 5.24.2.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

XXX All changes to installed files in F<cpan/>, F<dist/>, F<ext/> and F<lib/>

following sections using F<Porting/corelist-perldelta.pl>.  A paragraph summary
for important changes should then be added by hand.  In an ideal world,
dual-life modules would have a F<Changes> file that could be cribbed.

When building with GCC 6 and link-time optimization (the C<-flto> option to
C<gcc>), C<Configure> was treating all probed symbols as present on the
system, regardless of whether they actually exist. This has been fixed.
[perl #128131]

=item *

F<Configure> now aborts if both "-Duselongdouble" and "-Dusequadmath" are
requested.
L<[perl #126203]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=126203>

=item *

Fixed a bug in which F<Configure> could append "-quadmath" to the archname even
if it was already present.

Clang builds with "-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT" or "-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT_PRIVATE" have

[ List each fix as a =item entry ]

=over 4

=item *

Expressions containing an C<&&> or C<||> operator (or their synonyms C<and>
and C<or>) were being compiled incorrectly in some cases. If the left-hand
side consisted of either a negated bareword constant or a negated C<do {}>
block containing a constant expression, and the right-hand side consisted of
a negated non-foldable expression, one of the negations was effectively
ignored. The same was true of C<if> and C<unless> statement modifiers,
though with the left-hand and right-hand sides swapped. This long-standing
bug has now been fixed. [perl #127952]

=item *

C<reset> with an argument no longer crashes when encountering stash entries
other than globs. [perl #128106]

=item *

Assignment of hashes to, and deletion of, typeglobs named C<*::::::> no
longer causes crashes. [perl #128086]

=item *

Assignment variants of any bitwise ops under the C<bitwise> feature would
crash if the left-hand side was an array or hash.  [perl #128204]

=item *

socket() now leaves the error code returned by the system in C<$!> on
failure.  [perl #128316]

=item *

Parsing bad POSIX charclasses no longer leaks memory. [perl #128313]

=item *

Since Perl v5.20, line numbers have been off by one when perl is invoked
with the B<-x> switch.  This has been fixed. [perl #128508]

=item *

Some obscure cases of subroutines and file handles being freed at the same
time could result in crashes, but have been fixed.  The crash was
introduced in v5.22. [perl #128597]

=item *

Some regular expression parsing glitches could lead to assertion failures with
regular expressions such as C</(?<=/> and C</(?<!/>.  This has now been fixed.
L<[perl #128170]|https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=128170>

=item *

C<gethostent> and similar functions now perform a null check internally, to
avoid crashing with torsocks.  This was a regression from 5.22.  [perl
#128740]

=head1 Known Problems

XXX Descriptions of platform agnostic bugs we know we can't fix go here.  Any
tests that had to be C<TODO>ed for the release would be noted here.  Unfixed

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
