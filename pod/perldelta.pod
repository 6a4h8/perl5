=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.26.1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.26.0 release and the 5.26.1
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.25.0, first read
L<perl5260delta>, which describes differences between 5.25.0 and 5.26.0.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

XXX Any security-related notices go here.  In particular, any security
vulnerabilities closed should be noted here rather than in the
L</Selected Bug Fixes> section.

[ List each security issue as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

XXX Note that deprecated modules should be listed here even if they are listed
as an updated module in the L</Modules and Pragmata> section.

=head2 Updated Modules and Pragmata

=over 4

=item *

L<base> has been upgraded from version 2.25 to 2.26.

The effects of dotless C<@INC> on this module have been limited by the
introduction of a more refined and accurate solution for removing
C<'.'> from C<@INC> while reducing the false positives.

=item *

L<charnames> has been upgraded from version 1.44 to 1.45.

=item *

L<Module::CoreList> has been upgraded from version 5.20170530 to 5.20170903.

Support for compiling perl on Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio 2017

Building XS modules with C<gcc> 6 in a 64-bit build of Perl failed due to
incorrect mapping of C<strtoll> and C<strtoull>. This has now been fixed.

=item *

Several built-in functions previously had bugs that could cause them to
write to the internal stack without allocating room for the item being
written. In rare situations, this could have led to a crash. These bugs have
now been fixed, and if any similar bugs are introduced in future, they will
be detected automatically in debugging builds. [perl #131732]

=item *

Using a symbolic ref with postderef syntax as the key in a hash lookup was
yielding an assertion failure on debugging builds. [perl #131627]

=item *

List assignment (C<aassign>) could in some rare cases allocate an
entry on the mortal stack and leave the entry uninitialized. [perl
#131570]

=item *

Attempting to apply an attribute to an C<our> variable where a
function of that name already exists could result in a NULL pointer
being supplied where an SV was expected, crashing perl.  [perl
#131597]

=item *

The code that vivifies a typeglob out of a code ref made some false assumptions
that could lead to a crash in cases such as C<< $::{"A"} = sub {}; \&{"A"} >>.
This has now been fixed. [perl #131085]

=item *

C<my_atof2> no longer reads beyond the terminating NUL, which previously
occurred if the decimal point is immediately before the NUL. [perl #131526]

=item *

Occasional "Malformed UTF-8 character" crashes in C<s//> on utf8 strings have
been fixed. [perl #131575]

=item *

C<perldoc -f s> now finds C<s///>. [perl #131371]

=item *

Some erroneous warnings after utf8 conversion have been fixed. [perl #131190]

=item *

The C<jmpenv> frame to catch Perl exceptions is set up lazily, and this used
to be a bit too lazy. The catcher is now set up earlier, preventing some
possible crashes. [perl #105930]

=item *

Spurious "Assuming NOT a POSIX class" warnings have been removed. [perl #131522]

=head1 Known Problems

XXX Descriptions of platform agnostic bugs we know we can't fix go here.  Any
tests that had to be C<TODO>ed for the release would be noted here.  Unfixed

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
