L<perl5241delta>, which describes differences between 5.24.0 and 5.24.1.

=head2 Improved handling of '.' in @INC in base.pm

The handling of (the removal of) C<'.'> in C<@INC> in L<base> has been
improved.  This resolves some problematic behaviour in the approach taken in
Perl 5.24.1, which is probably best described in the following two threads on
the Perl 5 Porters mailing list:
L<http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/08/msg238991.html>,
L<http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/10/msg240297.html>.

=head2 "Escaped" colons and relative paths in PATH

On Unix systems, Perl treats any relative paths in the PATH environment
variable as tainted when starting a new process.  Previously, it was allowing a
backslash to escape a colon (unlike the OS), consequently allowing relative
paths to be considered safe if the PATH was set to something like C</\:.>.  The
check has been fixed to treat C<.> as tainted in that example.

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.
