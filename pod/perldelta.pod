=head1 NAME

[ this is a template for a new perldelta file.  Any text flagged as XXX needs
to be processed before release. ]

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.22.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.22.1 release and the 5.22.2
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.0, first read
L<perl5221delta>, which describes differences between 5.22.0 and 5.22.1.

=head1 Notice

XXX Any important notices here

=head1 Core Enhancements

XXX New core language features go here.  Summarize user-visible core language
enhancements.  Particularly prominent performance optimisations could go
here, but most should go in the L</Performance Enhancements> section.

[ List each enhancement as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Security

=head2 fix out of boundary access in Win32 path handling

This is CVE-2015-8608.  For more information see
L<[perl #126755]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126755>

=head2 fix loss of taint in canonpath

This is CVE-2015-8607.  For more information see
L<[perl #126862]|https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126862>

=head2 Set proper umask before calling C<mkstemp(3)>

In 5.22 perl started setting umask to 0600 before calling C<mkstemp(3)>
and restoring it afterwards. This wrongfully tells open(2) to strip
the owner read and write bits from the given mode before applying it,
rather than the intended negation of leaving only those bits in place.

Systems that use mode 0666 in C<mkstemp(3)> (like old versions of
glibc) createa a file with permissions 0066, leaving world read and
write permissions regardless of current umask.

This has been fixed by using umask 0177 instead. [perl #127322]

=head1 Incompatible Changes

XXX For a release on a stable branch, this section aspires to be:

    There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.XXX.XXX
    If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
    report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

[ List each incompatible change as a =head2 entry ]

=head1 Deprecations

XXX Any deprecated features, syntax, modules etc. should be listed here.

=head2 Module removals

XXX Remove this section if inapplicable.

The following modules will be removed from the core distribution in a
future release, and will at that time need to be installed from CPAN.
Distributions on CPAN which require these modules will need to list them as
prerequisites.

The core versions of these modules will now issue C<"deprecated">-category
warnings to alert you to this fact.  To silence these deprecation warnings,
install the modules in question from CPAN.

Note that these are (with rare exceptions) fine modules that you are encouraged
to continue to use.  Their disinclusion from core primarily hinges on their
necessity to bootstrapping a fully functional, CPAN-capable Perl installation,
not usually on concerns over their design.

=item *

Calls to the placeholder C<&PL_sv_yes> used internally when an
import() or unimport() method isn't found now correctly handle scalar
context.  [perl #126042]

=item *

The pipe() operator would assert for DEBUGGING builds instead of
producing the correct error message.  The condition asserted on is
detected and reported on correctly without the assertions, so the
assertions were removed.  [perl #126480]

=item *

In some cases, failing to parse a here-doc would attempt to use freed
memory.  This was caused by a pointer not being restored correctly.
[perl #126443]

=item *

Report more context when we see an array where we expect to see an
operator and avoid an assertion failure.  [perl #123737]

=item *

If a here-doc was found while parsing another operator, the parser had
already read end of file, and the here-doc was not terminated, perl
could produce an assertion or a segmentation fault.  This now reliably
complains about the unterminated here-doc.  [perl #125540]

=item *

Caching of DESTROY methods could result in a non-pointer or a
non-STASH stored in the SvSTASH() slot of a stash, breaking the B
STASH() method.  The DESTROY method is now cached in the MRO metadata
for the stash.  [perl #126410]

=item *

Avoid parsing beyond the end of the buffer when processing a C<#line>
directive with no filename.  [perl #127334]

=head1 Known Problems

XXX Descriptions of platform agnostic bugs we know we can't fix go here.  Any

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
https://rt.perl.org/ .  There may also be information at
http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send it
to perl5-security-report@perl.org.  This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who will be
able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported.  Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently distributed on
CPAN.
