L<perl5240delta>, which describes differences between 5.23.0 and 5.24.0.

=head2 B<-Di> switch is now required for PerlIO debugging output

Previously PerlIO debugging output would be sent to the file specified by the
C<PERLIO_DEBUG> environment variable if perl wasn't running setuid and the
B<-T> or B<-t> switches hadn't been parsed yet.

If perl performed output at a point where it hadn't yet parsed its switches
this could result in perl creating or overwriting the file named by
C<PERLIO_DEBUG> even when the B<-T> switch had been supplied.

Perl now requires the B<-Di> switch to produce PerlIO debugging output.  By
default this is written to C<stderr>, but can optionally be redirected to a
file by setting the C<PERLIO_DEBUG> environment variable.

If perl is running setuid or the B<-T> switch was supplied C<PERLIO_DEBUG> is
ignored and the debugging output is sent to C<stderr> as for any other B<-D>
switch.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.24.0.  If any exist,
they are bugs, and we request that you submit a report.  See

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION> for details of how to
report the issue.
