=head1 NAME

perldelta - what is new for perl v5.28.2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes differences between the 5.28.1 release and the 5.28.2
release.

If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.28.0, first read
L<perl5281delta>, which describes differences between 5.28.0 and 5.28.1.

=head1 Incompatible Changes

There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.28.1
If any exist, they are bugs, and we request that you submit a
report.  See L</Reporting Bugs> below.

=head1 Platform Support

=head2 Platform-Specific Notes

=over 4

=item Windows

The Windows Server 2003 SP1 Platform SDK build, with its early x64 compiler and
tools, was accidentally broken in Perl 5.27.9.  This has now been fixed.

=item Mac OS X

Perl's build and testing process on Mac OS X for C<-Duseshrplib>
builds is now compatible with Mac OS X System Integrity Protection
(SIP).

SIP prevents binaries in F</bin> (and a few other places) being passed
the C<DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH> environment variable.  For our purposes this
prevents C<DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH> from being passed to the shell, which
prevents that variable being passed to the testing or build process,
so running C<perl> couldn't find F<libperl.dylib>.

To workaround that, the initial build of the F<perl> executable
expects to find F<libperl.dylib> in the build directory, and the
library path is then adjusted during installation to point to the
installed library.

[perl #126706]

=head1 Selected Bug Fixes

=over 4

=item *

If an in-place edit is still in progress during global destruction and
the process exit code (as stored in C<$?>) is zero, perl will now
treat the in-place edit as successful, replacing the input file with
any output produced.

This allows code like:

  perl -i -ne 'print "Foo"; last'

to replace the input file, while code like:

  perl -i -ne 'print "Foo"; die'

will not.  Partly resolves [perl #133659].

=item *

A regression in 5.28 caused the following code to fail

 close(STDIN); open(CHILD, "|wc -l")'

because the child's stdin would be closed on exec. This has now been fixed.

=item *

C<pack "u", "invalid uuencoding"> now properly NUL terminates the
zero-length SV produced.  [perl #132655]

=item *

Failing to compile a format now aborts compilation.  Like other errors
in sub-parses this could leave the parser in a strange state, possibly
crashing perl if compilation continued.  [perl #132158]

=head1 Reporting Bugs

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database
at L<https://rt.perl.org/> .  There may also be information at
L<http://www.perl.org/> , the Perl Home Page.

If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the L<perlbug> program
included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny but
sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the output of C<perl -V>,
will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.

If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
L<perlsec/SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION>
for details of how to report the issue.

=head1 Give Thanks

If you wish to thank the Perl 5 Porters for the work we had done in Perl 5,
you can do so by running the C<perlthanks> program:

    perlthanks

This will send an email to the Perl 5 Porters list with your show of thanks.
