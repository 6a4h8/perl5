This file contains a description of all the shell variables whose value is
determined by the Configure script.  Variables intended for use in C
programs (e.g. I_UNISTD) are already described in config_h.SH.  [`configpm'
generates pod documentation for Config.pm from this file--please try to keep
the formatting regular.]
